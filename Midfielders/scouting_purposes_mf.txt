For midfielders, the dataset includes both defensive midfielders, who typically exhibit more defensive behavior, and attacking midfielders, who tend to contribute more offensively. To achieve balance and identify players excelling in both profiles, we tried to choose similar weights for defensive and offensive attributes, as shown in performance_mf.png, which presents the weights and variables for the performance_mf formula. We prioritized midfielders with good passing and marking skills. Additionally, attributes related to aerial duels and offsides were excluded, as they were not considered relevant for our analysis of midfielders. Lastly, as on the correlations observed in the forwardsâ€™ dataset, we removed the variables \textit{Unsuccessful Take-Ons/90}, \textit{Successful Take-Ons/90}, \textit{Shots on Target/90}, and \textit{Shots off Target/90}, replacing them with more informative rate-based metrics: \textit{Successful Take-Ons Rate} and \textit{Shots on Target Rate}.
