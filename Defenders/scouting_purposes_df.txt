For defenders, we rely on full-backs, who can be more offensive, and center-backs, who tend to be more defensive. To achieve balance, we assigned similar weights to variables for both types. We tried to penalize players with a lot of crucial errors, such as own goals and red cards, and prioritize players with good defensive numbers, such as tackles and interceptions, as well as players with good assist numbers. The file "performance_df.png" contains the variables and their weights used in the performance_df formula and sumarizes our scouting purposes for defenders. Of the correlated variables, all were relevant to our case, so we kept them. Number of penalty goals and missed penalties were of no interest to us for defenders, so we removed these variables first.
