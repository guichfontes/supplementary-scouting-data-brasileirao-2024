For goalkeepers, we removed virtually all variables for which goalkeepers rarely have a value greater than 0 (e.g., goals and assists). Therefore, we prioritized goalkeepers with a high number of saves and clean sheets and a low number of goals conceded. Because there were many negative attributes, penalties were not so severe as to not drastically reduce the performance value. Treatment of correlated variables was not necessary, and some rates, such as clean sheet rate per game, could favor goalkeepers with few appearances. The file "performance_gk.png" contains the variables and their weights used in the performance_gk formula and sumarizes our scouting purposes for goalkeepers.
